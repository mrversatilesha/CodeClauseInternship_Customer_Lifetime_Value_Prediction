# CodeClauseInternship_Customer_Lifetime_Value_Prediction

We can predict the value of customers to a company by evaluating its various factors and then training a regression model to evaluate the value. The higher the value, the more valuable the customer is.
There are various factors we are considering here to predict the value :

### The factors on which we can predict the customer value  : 
-gender: Can provide demographic insights that affect purchasing behaviour.

-area: Geographic location impacts economic factors and customer preferences.

-qualification: Reflects education level which can correlate with income and spending behaviour.

-marital_status: Affects spending habits and insurance needs.

-claim_amount: Reflects the extent of engagement and potential value.

-num_policies: More policies often mean higher CLV.

-policy: Details about policies can indicate customer engagement and value.

-type_of_policy: Different policies have different values and risks associated.

-lower_income: Income level directly impacts purchasing power.

-higher_income: Provides additional granularity on income, affecting purchasing power.



Upon these factors, i trained a regression model with a best parameter hyper parameter tuning to predict the value of customers to a company.
